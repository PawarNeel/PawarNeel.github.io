# Neel Pawar’s Engineering Portfolio

---

For as long as I can remember I have had a curiosity for how things worked, which often led me to taking things apart. This fascination has fostered a passion in making things, whether they be rockets, drones, furniture or teams of people.   

Currently, I lead the development of cutting-edge products at Safety Dave, where I am taking projects from concept to commercial production. During my time at the University of Melbourne Rocketry Team, I’ve driven the technical success of multiple projects, including leading the team to 2nd place at the Spaceport America Cup in 2024. 

My expertise spans both mechanical design and electrical design with a strong focus on integrating them together with robust systems engineering practices and hands-on leadership.
