# ARES - Novel Parachute Recovery

## Developing Novel Methods of Parachute Recovery

Recovery systems are often the most neglected areas within amateur rocketry, and unsurprisingly are often the cause of many failed flights.  We aimed to solve this in Project Florence. Under the guidance of an experienced skydiving parachute rigger we developed an extremely robust and performant recovery system.
