# ARES - Project Phobos - 2022

During Project Phobos I served multiple roles in the team. I was primarily tasked with lead the payload team which was investigating the g force loading on the c6 section of the human spine. I was also responsible for BP separation system which separates the rocket, allowing the parachutes to come out.
